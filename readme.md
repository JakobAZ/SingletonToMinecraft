# Mission Statement
This repository exists so I can host and manage my code related to refreshing and deepening my machine learning knowledge and practice git and github at the same time. 
We will start out by coding a single neuron with "normal" libraries (probably numpy) and then work our way through densely connected deep neural nets, more nifty constructions like convolutional nets and LSTM-nets hopefully all the way up to some reinforcement learning.
