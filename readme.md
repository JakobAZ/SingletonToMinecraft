# Mission Statement
This repository exists so I can host and manage my code related to refreshing and deepening my machine learning knowledge and practice git and github at the same time. 
We will start out by coding a single neuron with "normal" libraries (probably numpy) and then work our way through densely connected deep neural nets, more nifty constructions like convolutional nets and LSTM-nets hopefully all the way up to some reinforcement learning. 

The 3-year goal is to build an AI that successfully controls multiple Minecraft-instances to cooperatively build a given building in a given spot. 

This technology has implications for <ul> 
<li>construction: reducing the need for workers who are not just getting more expensive as world-GDP per capita expands but are also exposed to significant risks during construction works. This could improve housing affordability and availability.
<li>replicators: replicators on earth have one big problem, resources are costly. In space, there is a lot of material nobody really needs. Self-replicating robots that need no or hardly any supervision could operate in regions of space that are an uncomfortable amount of light-seconds away or hidden behind the sun. They could then grow their number to a predefined population size and then start performing useful tasks.
<li>asteroid mining: using hardly-supervised replicators, asteroid mining will become infinitesimally cheap. Robots are also much more adaptable to outer-space conditions than humans. The useful task for our population of replicators could be to send resources to earth.
<li>colonizing celestial bodies: with the same reasoning as for asteroid-mining, replicators could build a moon-base that serves as an assembly line for human-carrying spacecraft, or space-based observatories. They could also be used to build a satelite-network connecting the moon's complete surface to Earth's internet making it possible to run ground-based observatories on the "dark" side of the moon and send their images back to earth.


## Why Minecraft? 
Minecraft is a simplified version of the real world and comes with easy ways to give the AI multiple "bodies" (player entities controlled by the central AI) that gather data and perform actions, very much like a swarm of robots that are tasked to construct some given building in a given space. We will call the individual player-entities platforms borrowing a term from Mass Effect 2 where Shepard encounters the Geth Legion who at some point (I don't recall) explains that Geth are not individuals, the individual robots are just platforms on which certain programmes of the collective Geth-mind are running.

An intelligence able to make sense of all the information gathered by the platforms and to coordinate their actions towards a common goal (also choosing their utility functions) constitutes one ingredient to revolutionizing construction through robots. Another ingredient is robots that are dexterous enough to serve as platforms building stuff but this is not our area of expertise (yet).
